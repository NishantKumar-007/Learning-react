Hooks cont.
--------------------------------------------------
1.Best practises
    - dont create state variables inside if-else/condition/for loop.
    - dont create state variables inside a function.

All about Routing
------------------------------------------------
1.npm install react-router-dom
2.import {createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider} from react-router-dom.
3.const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
    {path:"/", 
    element:<Home />,
    errorElement:<ErrorPage /> // to display error page if url doesn't match.
    },
    {path:"/contact", element:<Contact />}
    ......//add as many as u want.
]);
4.root.render(<RouterProvider  router={appRouter}/>);
5.react-router-dom also provides a new hook called useRouteError.
    - how to use
        - const err = useRouteError();
            console.log(err);
6.Children routes ->
    a.<Outlet /> - displays children component based on path provided.
    b.don't use <a></a> tag in react to move to other page, it reloads the whole page
    c.Here we use <Link to="/adsdada" />, it just renders the component instead of reloading the whole page.
7. SPA - Single Page Application
8.Types of routing in webapps - Client Side Routing (what we are doing in this project.)
                              - Server Side Routing
9.Creating page for each individual restaurant
    -Dynamic Routing -> "/home/:id"
10.useProps hook - 
11.useRouteError hook - 


Notes: i.shortcut to create a component -> type rafce -> hit enter
       ii. Read about different types of router other than createBrowserRouter.
       iii. key should be present on the parent JSX that is being mapped.
